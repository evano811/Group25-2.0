# User Survey Report

## Observation 1:

- **Users will want directions to go to a events on campus:**
  
- **Out of all responses, only one person said that they would not want direction to go to events they see on the app. Everyone else stated that they would want a map (32) or wanted it as an option (21). We can infer that users would either want directions when they use the app or when they do not know how to get to the event they want to.**
  
- **Team Action: Attempt to implement directions to events placed on map. Maybe based on nearest building or street address**
