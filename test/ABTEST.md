# A/B Testing - MapIt #


**A/B Test 1:** Color Scheme

**User Story 1**

**NPS**

**Hypothesis:** The problem here is what color scheme the user would actually want. We do not want things to be hard to see nor do we want our app to be too bright. Our hypothesis is that making a color scheme that is easy on the eyes but also clearly shows the user the important parts o fthe app will contribute to a better user experience.

**Experiment:** To experiment on this hypothesis, different versions of the app will be made withh different color schemes. The target audience is the users of the app. All of the users should be able to participate in this, since it is a major part of the app so we want all of our users to share their input.

**Variations:** One variation is a white background with blue buttons. Another variation is blue background with white buttons. Rationale behind these two is that the white background will provide clear definition of app layout, while the blue background could possibly be easier on the eyes.



**A/B Test 2:** Should the App have a Profile Section?

**User Story 2**

**Adoption**

**Hypothesis:** Should we implement a Profile to our APP? The main idea is to add more social activities to our app. The profile section will have some basic information that the user would like to add to their profile, Name, Birthday and so on. This profile will be used to show who and how many people are attending each event. If a user would like to go to an event they can register using their profile, this will allow the event cordinators and other users to see who is attending the event. 

**Experiment:** We will create a survey to see if people like the idea (So we don't have to code anyhting just yet). If the survey comes in mostly positive then we will test out the idea by creating a Profile App first and then adding the a registration for each event. This does not have to come out with the app at first this can be an added feature towards the future if the users like the feature. 



**A/B Test 3:** Notifications

**User Story 3**

**Engagement**

**Hypothesis:**
Users will demonstrate increased engagement and retention if they are provided with the option to save events and receive notifications for upcoming saved events.

**Experiment:**
To test this hypothesis, we will introduce a feature allowing users to save events to a personalized list and opt-in to receive notifications for saved events. We hypothesize that users who utilize this feature will exhibit higher engagement levels and retention rates compared to those who do not have access to this feature.

**Variations:**
- Variant A (Control): Users do not have the option to save events or receive notifications for upcoming events.
- Variant B (Experimental): Users are provided with the option to save events to a personalized list and opt-in to receive notifications for saved events.

**A/B Test 4:** Notifications

**User Story 4**

**Click-Through Rate**

**Hypothesis:**
There is no use to an app that is difficult to navigate through! We want to make sure that our users are able to navigate through all of the great features of our app, such as our map and list views, along with event details. We also want to make a personalized experience for all, so that they can access the features most relevant to them. Users who are able to log in and are brought directly through the app to their most useful screen are more likely to use the app more efficiently. The less time a user takes to find their desired event, the better!

**Experiment:**
To test our hypothesis, we will introduce personal preferences to the application. At first it can be as simple as a short survey that asks our users if they would like a feature to save preferences, and what preferences they would like to save. Then we would roll out an experimental version of the features most popular amongst our users in order to determine whether these preferences would be beneficial to user experience.

**Variations:**
- Variant A (Control): Users will be brought to a default view and will navigate to their desired screen manually.
- Variant B (Experimental): Users will be brought to their "favorite" screen, which will be customizable through a setting the user must set.
