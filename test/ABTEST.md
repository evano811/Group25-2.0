**A/B Test 1:** Color Scheme
**User Story 1**
**NPS**
**Hypothesis:** The problem here is what color scheme the user would actually want. We do not want things to be hard to see nor do we want our app to be too bright. Our hypothesis is that making a color scheme that is easy on the eyes but also clearly shows the user the important parts o fthe app will contribute to a better user experience.

**Experiment:** To experiment on this hypothesis, different versions of the app will be made withh different color schemes. The target audience is the users of the app. All of the users should be able to participate in this, since it is a major part of the app so we want all of our users to share their input.

**Variations:** One variation is a white background with blue buttons. Another variation is blue background with white buttons. Rationale behind these two is that the white background will provide clear definition of app layout, while the blue background could possibly be easier on the eyes.
