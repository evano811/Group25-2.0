#A/B Test 1: Color Scheme
**User Story 1**
**NPS**
**Hypothesis:** The problem here is what color scheme the user would actually want. We do not want things to be hard to see nor do we want our app to be too bright. Our hypothesis is that making a color scheme that is easy on the eyes but also clearly shows the user the important parts o fthe app will contribute to a better user experience.

**Experiment:** To experiment on this hypothesis, different versions of the app will be made withh different color schemes. The target audience is the users of the app. All of the users should be able to participate in this, since it is a major part of the app so we want all of our users to share their input.

**Variations:** One variation is a white background with blue buttons. Another variation is blue background with white buttons. Rationale behind these two is that the white background will provide clear definition of app layout, while the blue background could possibly be easier on the eyes.

**A/B Test 2:** Should the App have a Profile Section?

**User Story 2**

**Adoption**

**Hypothesis:** Should we implement a Profile to our APP? The main idea is to add more social activities to our app. The profile section will have some basic information that the user would like to add to their profile, Name, Birthday and so on. This profile will be used to show who and how many people are attending each event. If a user would like to go to an event they can register using their profile, this will allow the event cordinators and other users to see who is attending the event. 

**Experiment:** We will create a survey to see if people like the idea (So we don't have to code anyhting just yet). If the survey comes in mostly positive then we will test out the idea by creating a Profile App first and then adding the a registration for each event. This does not have to come out with the app at first this can be an added feature towards the future if the users like the feature.
