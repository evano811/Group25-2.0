## Metrics Analysis

### Metric 1 NPS

Implement a survey question to display for users to vote on how well they enjoyed using the app.

  
### Metric 2 Adoption

We will analyze the adoption of new users by having them create an account and confirm their them with their email. We will have the data of all the new users backed in our Real Time Database.

  
### Metric 3 DAU

We can find how many people are logged on the app at any given time frame: day, week, month, etc.

  
### Metric 4: CTR (Click-Through Rate)

If a user clicks through to the final screen (details screeen of an event), we can increment a counter variable named cick-through by one

  
### Metric 5 Retention 

Of previous users, track how many come back and login to the app. So just tracking how many users login instead of sign up.
